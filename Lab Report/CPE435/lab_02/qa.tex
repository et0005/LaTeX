    \subsection{Part 1}\label{subsec:part1_qa}
        Part 1 of the lab explored manipulating a variable from within a parent process and within a child process.
        The variable, named "val", was initialized to "0" and then incremented by different values from both the parent and child processes.
        The child should increment "val" by 2, and the parent should increment "val" by 5.

        \medskip
        \noindent This procedure then posed the question:
        \medskip

        \say{What can you conclude about the values of the variable \say{val}?}

        \medskip
        \noindent Based on the output of Part 1, as shown in figure~\ref{fig:part1_output}, we see that each process resulted in unique values of "val".
        This indicates that the parent and child do not share the same memory and that each process has its own area of memory protected against modification by other processes.
