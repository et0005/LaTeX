    Processes can be used to our advantage when developing larger programs.
    In particular it seems that ones with very specific order of operations, \texttt{wait()} or \texttt{waitpid()} would ensure that order is maintained.
    The protected memory could be an advantage and a disadvantage if the results of processes depended on each other you'd have to plan ahead.
