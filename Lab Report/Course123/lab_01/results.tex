        \noindent The source code for this portion of the lab was written and compiled on a lab workstation.
        The code itself is included at the end of this report in Appendix~\ref{sec:part1_source}.
        Upon implementing, compiling, and running Part 1 the output to console was screenshot.
        That console output is shown on the following page in Figure \ref{fig:part1_output}.
